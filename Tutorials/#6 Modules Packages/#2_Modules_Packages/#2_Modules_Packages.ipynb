    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__.\n",

    "A package is a collection of modules in directories that give a package hierarchy. It is a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”. A.B stands for a submodule named B in a package named A. Two different packages like P1 and P2 can both have modules with the same name, let’s say M, for example. The submodule M of the package P1 and the submodule M of the package P2 can be totally different. A package is imported like a module, but we use the dot (.) operator to access the modules contained in the package. Finally the __init__.py file is required for Python to treat the directories as containing packages. The syntax to call a module from a package is the following:\n",
